# Modular-Scalable-Active-Balancing-Architecture

This repository contains the PCB design files of a modular scalable active cell balancing architecture proposed during my tenure as Research Associate in TUM CREATE. 

The PCBs are designed using Easily Accessible Graphical Layout Editor (EAGLE) 7.1.0 for windows. 
However, other versions of the software shall also be used for viewing and further modifying the design.

Scientific journals supporting the repository and explaining its working principle are submitted and under review process.
