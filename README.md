# Modular-Scalable-Active-Balancing-Architecture

This repository contains the PCB design files of a modular scalable active cell balancing architecture proposed by me. 

The PCBs are designed using Easily Accessible Graphical Layout Editor (EAGLE) 7.1.0 for windows. 
However, other versions of the software shall also be used for viewing and further modifying the design.
